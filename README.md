# Coupon Dev Project

The goal of the coupon project was to send offer data from the database to the browser as JSON and then display the offers in the browser as a single page application (SPA).

# Getting Started

Please go into the directories:

`coupon-dev-backend`

and

`coupon-dev-frontend`

to find more details about each part of the project and how to run it. You will need to run the backend and the frontend simultaneously.
